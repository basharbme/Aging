A table of the methylation markers included in the primary aging model. The coefficient listed for each marker is its regression coefficient within the model. A second table is provided for the model based on all samples (primary and validation).

- mmc2_Model_Primary_data.* - The 71 age-associated methylation regions included in the primary aging model.
- mmc2_Model_All_data.* - The 89 age-associated methylation regions identified using all data. 60 of them are the same as those identified in primary data (see mmc2.png).

To investigate the similarities and differences between the tissues, we built an age model for breast, kidney, and lung tissues. The skin cohort did not have enough samples to build a model. The markers and coefficients of each model are listed here.

- mmc3_Model_Breast/Kidney/Lung.bed - tissue-specific age-associated markers. See mmc3 info about their overlap.

 - mmc5_Genes_all/neg/pos_S7.* - 55 genes predictive of age based by their expression, whole blood, data not related to methylation data. 24 of these genes showed positive correlation with age by expression, 31 were found to be negatively correlated with age
