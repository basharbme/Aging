## Files and folders description

Scripts and data files for the epigenomic enrichment analysis of age-associated differentially methylated regions, and genes changing their expression with age.

- `data` - scripts to extract genomic coordinates of the age-associated genomic regions. The description of this folder contains the list of studies and the data available from them.

- `Illumina` - scripts to extract genomic coordinates of all CpG probes from Illumina Infinium 27K and Illumina Infinium 450K

- `GenomeRunner` - the results of the epigenomic enrichment analysis, and the scripts to process them

- `R.Aging` - R scripts for visualization of the results.

	- `genes_promoters_extract.Rmd` - extract promoters (+2000..-500bp arount TSS) of age-associated _genes_ (`data` folder).
