Analysis of age-related genomic regions
----------------------------------------

Inspired by [Cory Giles](https://github.com/gilesc) and Hannum G. et. al. paper ["Genome-wide methylation profiles reveal quantitative views of human aging rates"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512008933). 

Initial analysis of 71 age-associated methylation regions for epigenomic signatures.
